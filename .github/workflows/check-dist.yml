# In TypeScript actions, `dist/index.js` is a special file. When you reference
# an action with `uses:`, `dist/index.js` is the code that will be run. For this
# project, the `dist/index.js` file is generated from other source files through
# the build process. We need to make sure that the checked-in `dist/index.js`
# file matches what is expected from the build.
#
# This workflow will fail if the checked-in `dist/index.js` file does not match
# what is expected from the build.
